# Sports app

## To run project
1. Checkout/download source
2. Run `npm install` in project root
3. Run `npm start`

### Notes
* Redux state could be more consistant and have some improvements, this was done to show several approaches.
* State is saved to localStorage in default JS way. Redux-persis could've been used, but wasn't because of my time constraint and simplicity.
* Some components could've been more consolidated or splitted even more. Stuck to the middleground.
* App is not 100% covered by unit tests, but I've tried to include all different types of tests needed.
* Css could use some improvement, but for Css examples, there are other projects in my repo (if needed).
* E2e tests were not added, examples can be found in other projects if needed.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
